A way to see what your tweetstream will look like if you were to follow a user.


## Setup

1. Clone with `git clone git@github.com:pyrmont/follow.git` and set up libraries with `bundle`
2. Set up configuration with `bundle exec rake dev:setup`
3. (Optional) Start a dev instance with `bundle exec rails s`, or test with `bundle exec rake spec`.
